My GitHub Poem
The "Over the mountain" Branch

The Learning of a brand new skill,
is a trepiditious task for me,
but, if what I do doth turn out ill,
I shall peservere and will not flee.

I will continue on this lonely road,
till it finds some larger way,
where many new career prospects meet,
and wither then, I cannot say.

On this steep and winding path,
amidst vast hills all spectre grey,
I will continue to advance,
until the summit I obtain.

Java script I will learn,
and study hard for all to see,
and node.js and react,
postgress, git and http colon forward slash forward slash
